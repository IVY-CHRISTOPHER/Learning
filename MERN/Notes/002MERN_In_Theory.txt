How MERN Works Together

How to connect React + Node, Express, MongoDB
Different Approaches

"The Big Picture"
    React Client (Browser) - Presentation/ UI
    React is responsible for what the user SEES
    React is based on JavaScript

    Server
    Node.js/ Express.js (Uses JavaScript code that is detached from the client (users) machine)
    Reachable by anyone
    Server and Client connect with AJAX (Request and Responses)
    Triggered from Client side and sent to Server
    Sent in JSON format (there are other formats but JSON is the most used)

    Database Server
    Runs the MongoDB engine
    Database server can run on the SAME machine as the Node/ Express machine or a DIFFERENT machine it DOESN'T MATTER
    Data Storage NOT File Storage (Product, price of a product, name of users)
    Node/Express Server Communicates with this server, NEVER send requests from the client straight to this server. CREDENTIALS WOULD BE EXPOSED HUGE SECURITY ISSUE

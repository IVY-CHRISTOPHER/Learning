Two ways of connecting Node + React

One server/computer that hosts Node API and React SPA
    Node (Express) API handles incoming requests
    Requests not targeting API routes return React SPA
    Data is exchanged between React App and Node API in JSON format

Two Separated Servers
    One server to serve our react frontend and one server that hosts the API
    Node (Express) API handles incoming requests
    React SPA served on separate static hosts
    Data is exchanged between React app and Node API in JSON format

Often you want to use separate Servers so you don't overload anything and it always runs smoothly
